## Your Winning Data Stack
You've essentially assembled a complete, high-level intelligence picture. Each source answers a different, critical question for the analyst:

NIST (NVD): Answers "What is it?"

This is your source of truth. It gives you the official CVSS score, severity, and technical description. It's the foundation of your analysis.

GitHub: Answers "How can it be exploited?"

This is your source of evidence. It provides the tangible Proof-of-Concept code that shows the vulnerability is not just theoretical.

KEV (CISA Catalog): Answers "Is it being used against people right now?"

This is your source of urgency. It's the signal that elevates a vulnerability from important to "drop everything and patch." This is a huge value-add for a demo.

MITRE (CWE): Answers "What kind of weakness is it?"

Most of the valuable, high-level data from MITRE, like the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), is already included in the JSON response from the NIST NVD API. So, you get this for free without needing a separate integration.
